# Security Policies and Procedures

This document is a guide on what to do when encountering a bug or security concern in the Hawken project.

## **Reporting Bugs**
Security is a major concern in any project and I take it very seriously in my projects. If any bugs or security flaws exist in the Hawken project I will fix it ASAP after it is reported. I appreciate any and all help with finding and fixing bugs in the application as it grows.

To report a bug or security concern, please email me at the email listed on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/robertcorponoi).

After receiving your email, I will acknowledge your concern and look into it and send a response back with my personal findings on the matter.

If there is a problem with a module that Hawken depends on (which at the time of this writing is only mocha as a dev dependency for testing), please send me and email so it can be followed up on or replaced and also contact the person/team responsible for maintaining that project. You can also report a vulnerability through the [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/report).
